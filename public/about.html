<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I was born in 1982 in a windswept Oregon town that declared itself a “single-use plastic–free emotional zone” years before anyone else cared. My dad was a fisherman who pivoted to consulting on ethical net repair, and my mom was a math teacher who believed every equation deserved equal representation. They raised me to believe the world could be saved if I just composted hard enough—and reader, I took that seriously.</p>

<p>After graduating with a degree in Post‑Capitalist Eco‑Spiritual Studies with a minor in Feelings About Whales, I joined a renewable energy think‑collective that measured success in organic smoothie consumption per capita. My career highlight was organizing a conference where we powered our microphones by group affirmation. For fun, I started a side project: “Justice for Waves,” a movement lobbying for the emotional rights of the Pacific Ocean. We didn’t win legislative support—but the ocean felt heard, which was the point.</p>

<p>Now back home, I run a cooperative called “ReBoat,” where we upcycle old fishing vessels into community spaces for ocean-positive slam poetry and zero-emission kombucha brewing. My weekends are packed: leading mindfulness protests against climate change denial, hosting inclusive drum circles for retired sea turtles, and moderating an online forum about ethical sunscreen. Scientists might call me eccentric—but the pelicans know I’m an icon.</p>
